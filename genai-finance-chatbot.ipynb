       "In the last few years, the use of chatbots has increased significantly. Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, either through text or voice commands. They are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies.\n",

       "1. 24/7 Availability: Chatbots are available 24/7, which means customers can access financial services at any time. This is particularly useful for customers in different time zones or those who prefer to manage their finances outside of traditional banking hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Personalized Experience: Chatbots can provide personalized financial advice based on a customer's financial history, investment preferences, and other factors. This helps customers make informed decisions about their finances.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Cost-Effective: Chatbots can handle routine tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, which frees up human customer service representatives to handle more complex queries. This reduces the workload on human customer service representatives and saves costs for the company.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Improved Customer Experience: Chatbots can provide a seamless and convenient customer experience by allowing customers to manage their finances through messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. This eliminates the need for customers to visit a physical branch or call customer service, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient.\n",
       "\n",
       "Examples of Chatbots in Finance\n",

Check the eligibility criteria: As mentioned earlier, you need to be an Indian resident/citizen, have got admission for a job oriented professional / technical courses offered by reputed universities, MBA, MCA, MS, etc, Degree / diploma courses like aeronautical, shipping, etc provided these are recognized by competent regulatory bodies in India/abroad for the purpose of employment in India / abroad.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Use the loan wisely: Remember that the loan is meant to help you finance your education, not to fund your lifestyle. Use the loan amount judiciously and repay the loan as per the repayment schedule to avoid any penalties or interest charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Stay in touch with the lender: Keep the lender informed about any changes in your address, contact details, or employment status. This will help the lender to update their records and ensure that you receive the loan benefits and services as per your requirements.\n",
